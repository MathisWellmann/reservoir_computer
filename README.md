# Reservoir Computer in Rust

# TODOS:
- Output activation function
- Output over extended state which included inputs 
- optional Feedback matrix
- implement benchmark chaotic dynamical systems
- implement lyapunov time for analysis purposes
- hyperparamter validation by introducing Params::new(..)
- linear regression weighting where newer targets have higher priority
  - this could be uniform, linear_decay, exp_decay or something else
