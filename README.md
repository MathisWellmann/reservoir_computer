# Reservoir Computer in Rust

# TODOS:
- implement benchmark chaotic dynamical systems
- implement lyapunov time for analysis purposes
- linear regression weighting where newer targets have higher priority
  - this could be uniform, linear_decay, exp_decay or something else
- Make error measure generic and add MAE as well as RMSE, which already exists
- Add all fields to all Cargo.toml files
